Course: The Odin Project: Fundamentals
Project: Recipes
Lesson: HTML & Git Basics

This project displays my HTML skills after moving through the first half of the course. The project includes a home page with three recipe pages.

To complete the project I used HTML to create the pages, link them together and also insert images. I used the git commands to add, commit and push my work to the GitHub repository. 

I had some difficulty remaining consistent with my commit messages and I was unsure which verbiage to use for html-type changes. 

Overall it was a simple and easy project to practice my skills.
