        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I totally free-styled this recipe after realizing that a small tub of yogurt was almost $10 at our local grocery store! I suppose the idea of fermenting dairy may turn people off who are not comfortable in the kitchen, but I promise you, making yogurt is SO easy!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>        
        <ul>
            <li>1 litre of homo milk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of store-bought yogurt</li>
        </ul>   
        <h3>Instructions</h3>  
        <ol>
            <li>Place the milk in a saucepan and heat to a boil while stirring so the milk doesn't burn.</li>
            <li>Once the mill begins to bubble up, remove the saucepan from the heat</li>
            <li>Leave on counter or in an ice bath until temperature reaches 110 - 115 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Add the 2 tablespoons of yogurt into a large 1 litre mason jar (or other container)</li>
            <li>Add the milk and stir.</li>
            <li>Find a warm place to incubate the yogurt for 5 to 7 hours.</li>
            <li>Test after 5 hours to check on flavour. I prefer waiting 7 hours as I like my yogurt more tangy.</li>
            <li>Place in the fridge to cool and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
